                About Me
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am currently studying at the Robert H. Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland,
                    College Park. My passions include web development and design, data science, and data analytics.
                    I have worked extensively with Tableau, Python, Java, and SQL over the course of my academic career.
                    <br>
                    I have also begun to use and familiarize myself with HTML and CSS (which is what this website is
                    built on!). Internships, such as one at Ciena, have equipped me with a strong understanding of PSA
                    and Salesforce. I wish to pursue a career in data science and am currently searching for an
                    internship in that field.
